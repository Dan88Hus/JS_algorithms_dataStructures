sorting is the process of an rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an arrray)
so that the items are in some kind of order 
 examplees
 sorting number from smallest to largest 
JS has built in .sort method but it doesnot work always the way oyu expect 

buble sort
    sorting algorithm where the largest values buble up to the top 
    iki rakami karsilastiriyoruz ve swap ediyoruz return degerine gore 
    start looping from with a variable v=called i the end of the array towards the beginning 
    start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i-1 
    if arr[j] is greater thatn arr[j+1] swap two values
    return the sorted array
    O(nSquare) generally , if array is mostly sorted dered its linear time 

selection sort 
    similar to buble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position,
    it places small values into sorted position
    ilk bir degeri sabit tutar digeri ile karsilastirir daha yeni deger kucuksek yeni min olur ve swap yapar 
    store the first element as the smallest value you have seen so far 
    compare this item to the next item in the aray until you find a smaller number 
    if a smaller number is found designate that smaller number to .
    if the minimum is not the value(index) you initially began with, swap the two values 
    repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted 
    O(nSquare) 
insertion sort 
burda swap yapmiyoruz baska bir variable deger atamasi yapip onla karsilatiriyoruz 
    pretty similar to buble sort 
    builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted 
    hatirliyor yerleri ve sonrakini gerekli yere aliyor solda ki ne gore 
        onceki degerlerini check ederek 
    start by picking the second element in the array 
    now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if neccessary 
    continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion
    (i.e. the left side) to place the element in the correct place 
    repeat it until the array is sorted and return the array 
    o(nSquare) in worst cases 
comparison of selection/insertion/buble sort 
    screenshot 
    buble sort, selection sort, insertion sort are all roughly equivalent 
    all have average time complexities that are quadratic 
    we can do better.. but we need more complex algorithms 
faster sorts (these family sorting algorthims that can improve time complexity from o(nSquare) to O(nLogn))
from o(nSquare) to o(nlogn) 
trade off between efficiency and simplicity

    merge sort
        its a combination of 2 things - merginf and sorting 
        we dividing array to split up hal half and half then we merge them together 
        by comparing left to right on each smaller array then merge 
        create an empty array, take aloot at the smallest values in each input array 
        while there are still values we havenot looked at...
            if the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array,
            push the value in the first array into our results and move on to the next value in the first array 
            if the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push the value in the second array into our results and move on the next value in the second array 
            once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array 
        -----------
        break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element 
        once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array 
        once the array has been back together return the merged(and sorted) array
        
    quick sort
    radix sort
