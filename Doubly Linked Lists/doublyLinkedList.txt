Almost identical to singly linked lists, except every node has another pointer to the previous node 
burda next sadece degil, previous item var ayni zamanda 
single linked listte back gidemiyoruz, ama doubly de more easy to go back 
more memory === more flexibility doubly linked list 
pushing pseudo 
    create a new node with the value passed to the function 
    if the head property is null set the head and tail to be newly created node 
    if not, set the next property on the tail to be that node 
    set the previous property on the newly created node to be the tail 
    set the tail to be newly created node 
    incrememnt the length 
    return the doubly linked list 
pop is removing a node from the end of doubly linked list 
pseudo 
    if there is no head, return undefined 
    store the current tail in a variable to return to be null 
    if the lenght is 1 set the head and tail to be null 
    update the tail to be the previous node 
    set the newTails' next to null 
    decrement length 
    return the value removed 
shifting removing a node from the beginning of the doubly linked list 
pseudo 137
    if lenght is 0, return undefined 
    stpre the current head property in avariable(we ll call ot old head )
    if the lenght is one 
        set the head to be null 
        set the tail to be null 
    update the head to be the next of the old head 
    set the heads' prev property to null 
    decrement the length
    return old head 
unshifting - adding a node to the beginning of the doubly linked list 
pseudo 
    create a node with the value passed to the function
    if the length is 0 
        set the head to be the new node
        set the tail to be the new node 
    otherwise
        set the prev property on the head of the list to be the new node 
        set the next property on the new node to be the head property 
        update the head to be the new node 
    increment the lenghth 
    return the list
