linear search on arrays 
    indexOf
    includes
    find
    findIndex
    .... all js searching methods , left to right
    O(n) - its linear 

binary search on sorted arrays 
    much faster form of search
    rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time 
    but only workd on sorted arrays 
    this function accepts a sorted array and a value
    create left pointer at the start of the array, and right pointer at the end of the array 
    while the left pointer comes before the right pointer: 
        create a pointer in the middle
        if you find the value you want, return the index 
        if the value is too small, move the left pointer up
        if you never find return -1
