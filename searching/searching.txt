linear search on arrays

    .... all js searching methods , left to right
    O(n) - its linear 

binary search on sorted arrays 
    much faster form of search
    rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time 
    but only workd on sorted arrays 
    this function accepts a sorted array and a value
    create left pointer at the start of the array, and right pointer at the end of the array 
    while the left pointer comes before the right pointer: 
        create a pointer in the middle
        if you find the value you want, return the index 
        if the value is too small, move the left pointer up
        if you never find return -1
        O(logn) is wort case and average case 
        o(1) is best case 

naive string searching algorithm,
    suppose you want to count the number of times a smaller string appears in a longer string 
    a straightforward approach involves checking pairs of charecters individually
        
    loopover the longer string
    loop over thr shorter string 
    if the characters dont match break out the inner loop
    if the characters do match keep going 
    if you complete the inner loop and find a match increment the count of matches 
    return the count
