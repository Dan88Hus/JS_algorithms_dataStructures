// ordered lists

use when you need order
when you need fast access/ insertion and removal (sort of..)
insertion it depends //because indexes are changing 
removal it depends //because indexes are changing 
searching o(n)
access o(1)

at the end oush and pop is always faster than shift and unshift methods
push                             o(1)
pop                              o(1)
shift                            o(n)
unshift                          o(n)
concat                           o(n)
slice                            o(n)
splice                           o(n)
sort                             o(n*logN)
forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc..  o(n)
