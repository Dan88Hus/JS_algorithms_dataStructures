they are both data structure collection of data 
stacks are LIFO data strucrute
    they are not a built in data structure in javascript, but are relatively simple to implement 

queues are FIFO

where stacks are used 
    managing fuction invocations 
    undo/redo functionality 
    routing(the history object) is treated like a stack 

there is more than one way of implementing a stack 
    array implementation
    linked list implementation 

pushing - add a value to the stack 
pseudo
    the fuction should accept a value 
    create a new node with that value 
    if there are no node in the stack, set the first and last property to be newly created node 
    if there is at least one node, create a variable that stores the current first property on the stack 
    reset the first property to be newly created node 
    set the next property on the node to be the previously created variable
    increment the size of the stack by 1 
    return incremented size
pop pseudo 
    if there are no nodes in the stack, return null 
    create a temporary variable to store the fisrt property on the stack 
    if there is only 1 node, set the first and last property to be null 
    if there is more thatn one node, set the first property to be the next property on the current first 
    decrement the size by 1 
    return the value of the node removed 
big O of stacks 
    insertion o(1)
    removal O(1)
    searching o(n)
    access o(n)

queues - FIFO
