trees - binary trees and binary search trees 
companre and contrast trees and lists 

trees is a data structure that consist of nodes in a parent/child relationship

lists - linear
trees - nonlinear 
tree terminology 
    root - the top node in a tree 
    child - a node directly connected to another node 
        when moving away from the root 
    parent - the converse notion of child

lots of different applications 
    html DOM 
    network routing 
    abstract syntax tree 
    artificial intelligence/ML 
    folders in operating systems 
    JSON

kind of trees - many variaties 
    heaps for example\
    polygon 
    triangle
    binary tree - each node can have at most 2 child / root cannot have 3 child 
    binary search trees - stores data that can be sortable (ordering)
        every parent node has at most 2 children 
        every node to the left of a parent node is always LESS than the parent \
        every node to the right of a parent node is ALWAYS GREATER than the parent
